# Overview

Data structure and algorithms visualizer (sorta) in C using raylib.

This little app lets you see visualization of such array sorting algorithms as: Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort etc. As well as learn about other data structures like graphs and tress.

**This project was made for fun and learning purposes: to get familiar with C, better understanding of data structures, mainly graphs and trees, and little implimentation reference repo if I will ever need to look up any of this stuff.**
